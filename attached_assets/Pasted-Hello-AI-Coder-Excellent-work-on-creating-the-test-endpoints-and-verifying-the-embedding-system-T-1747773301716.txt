Hello AI Coder,

Excellent work on creating the test endpoints and verifying the embedding system! The results confirming successful embedding generation and similarity search using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions) are a major step forward. This validates our core vector capabilities with OpenAI.

Your report notes that 17% of emails currently have embeddings and you've suggested crucial next steps for HNSW indexing and batch processing. Let's focus on these to make the current OpenAI-based embedding pipeline robust, efficient, and scalable.

Project: AI-Powered Email Task Manager (Business Critical)
Current Date for Context: Tuesday, May 20, 2025
Current Location Context: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

Focus for this Chunk:

Ensure HNSW (or IVFFlat) vector indexes are correctly created and active for the 1536-dimensional embedding_vector columns in both emails and tasks tables in PostgreSQL.
Implement batch processing for generating OpenAI embeddings for all emails (and tasks) that do not yet have them.
Refine the text length reduction/chunking strategy for OpenAI embedding generation.
I. Database - Vector Indexing (for 1536 Dimensions):

Verify/Create HNSW Indexes:
Action: Review your Alembic migration scripts. Confirm that an HNSW index (using vector_cosine_ops) is being created for emails.embedding_vector and tasks.embedding_vector, specifically for columns defined as VECTOR(1536).
If these indexes are missing or were defined for a different dimension, please create/update the necessary Alembic migration to add these HNSW indexes correctly for 1536 dimensions. Example:
Python
# In Alembic upgrade()
op.create_index(
    'ix_emails_embedding_vector_hnsw_cosine', 'emails',
    ['embedding_vector'], unique=False,
    postgresql_using='hnsw',
    postgresql_with={'m': 16, 'ef_construction': 64}, // Standard HNSW params
    postgresql_ops={'embedding_vector': 'vector_cosine_ops'}
)
# Similar for tasks.embedding_vector
Apply the migration.
II. Backend - Batch Embedding Generation (for OpenAI text-embedding-3-small):

New RQ/Celery Task for Batch Email Embedding (app/tasks/nlp_tasks.py):
Create a new task, e.g., batch_generate_openai_email_embeddings(connected_account_id: Optional[str] = None, batch_size: int = 100).
This task should:
Query the emails table for records where embedding_vector IS NULL (optionally for a specific connected_account_id or all accounts).
Process these emails in batches (e.g., batch_size of 50-100).
For each email in the batch:
Prepare its content (subject + body, apply refined text length reduction).
Call NlpService.generate_embedding() (which should be using the configured OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model).
Update the Email record with the embedding_vector and embedding_generated_at.
Commit changes to the database per batch.
Include logging for progress and error handling for individual emails within a batch.
Refine Text Length Reduction for OpenAI Embeddings (in NlpService or pre-processing):
Review and refine the strategy for truncating or intelligently chunking long texts before sending them to OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model (max tokens ~8191) to optimize for relevance, cost, and to avoid errors.
API Endpoint to Trigger Batch Embedding (Optional but useful admin tool):
Create a simple backend API endpoint (e.g., POST /admin/embeddings/generate-batch-emails-openai) that can trigger this batch_generate_openai_email_embeddings task.
Batch Task Embedding (Similar for Tasks):
Implement a similar batch RQ/Celery task batch_generate_openai_task_embeddings for tasks where embedding_vector IS NULL. Trigger this after the email batch processing or as a separate admin action.
III. Verification:

Index Verification: After migrations, use psql to confirm the HNSW indexes exist on emails.embedding_vector and tasks.embedding_vector and are built for VECTOR(1536).
Batch Processing Test:
Ensure a significant number of emails/tasks in your database do not have embeddings.
Trigger the new batch embedding task(s).
Monitor RQ worker logs (nlp queue).
Verify that embedding_vector fields are populated for the processed batches in the database.
Run your /api/test/vector-stats endpoint again. The percentage of items with embeddings should now be much higher or 100%.
Semantic Search Performance: After HNSW indexes are in place and most/all items have embeddings, re-test your /api/test/vector-similarity/{email_id} endpoint. Note if search performance is good, especially when querying against the fully embedded dataset.
Regarding Ollama nomic-embed-text (768-dim) vs. OpenAI (1536-dim):

Thank you for implementing multi-provider support in the AIService. For now, let's ensure the OpenAI (1536-dim) path is fully optimized and production-ready.
We will address the complexities of supporting user-selectable, different embedding dimensions (like 768-dim for Ollama nomic-embed-text) as a separate, subsequent enhancement chunk. This might involve schema changes (e.g., storing dimension with the vector, or separate columns) or a user-level choice that dictates the dimension for all their data.
This approach will ensure your current working OpenAI embedding pipeline is efficient, scalable, and performs well for search and RAG. Let me know when you're ready to test these indexing and batching improvements.

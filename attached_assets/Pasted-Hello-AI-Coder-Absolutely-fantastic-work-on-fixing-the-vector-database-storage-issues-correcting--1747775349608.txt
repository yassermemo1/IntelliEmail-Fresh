Hello AI Coder,

Absolutely fantastic work on fixing the vector database storage issues (correcting dimensions to 1536, adding HNSW/GiST indexes) and significantly enhancing the React HITL Review Interface! These are critical improvements.

With the backend AI data pipeline (including embeddings) now robust and the HITL UI functional, let's focus on ensuring our Adaptive Learning System is working end-to-end. You've previously implemented the backend components for this (processing feedback, applying adaptations) and the frontend UI for insights/suggestions. Now we need to test the full loop.

Project: AI-Powered Email Task Manager (Business Critical)
Current Date for Context: Wednesday, May 21, 2025
Current Location Context: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

Focus for this Chunk:
Conduct end-to-end testing and any necessary refinements for the Adaptive Learning System. This means verifying that:

User interactions and HITL review feedback are correctly logged.
The backend 'Adaptive Learning Engine' (RQ/Celery tasks in learning_tasks.py) processes this feedback and correctly updates user_adaptation_profiles.
The AI processing pipeline (extract_features_from_email and generate_tasks_from_email_features) then uses these updated adaptation profiles to personalize its output for subsequent email processing.
The frontend 'Personalization Insights' and 'Suggested Rules' UIs reflect these learned adaptations.
Prerequisites:

All backend services (FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector with 1536-dim vectors and HNSW indexes, Redis, RQ workers including learning queue, Ollama) are operational.
The React frontend has functional UIs for Task Management, HITL Review, and the Settings sections for Personalization Insights & Suggested Rules.
Logging mechanisms for user_task_interactions and feedback_logs are active.
The AdaptationLearningService and its integration into the AI pipeline (for applying preferences) are implemented.
Testing Scenarios & Verification Steps:

Scenario 1: Learning from HITL Priority Correction

Setup:
Ensure a specific test user has a clear user_adaptation_profiles or it's empty.
Process a new email (Email A) from a unique sender (e.g., "priority_test_sender@example.com") for this user. Let the AI suggest a task with, say, "Medium" priority. Ensure this task is flagged for HITL review.
User Action (via React HITL UI): Review the task from Email A and manually change its priority to "High" and approve it.
Backend Verification:
Confirm a feedback_logs entry (or user_task_interactions entry) is created reflecting this priority change for this user and sender/email pattern.
Trigger Learning Engine: Manually trigger the relevant RQ/Celery task(s) from learning_tasks.py that process feedback for this user.
Backend Verification: Check the user_adaptation_profiles for this user. Does it now contain a learned preference indicating that emails/tasks from "priority_test_sender@example.com" (or similar keywords) should lean towards "High" priority? (Show the updated profile snippet).
Test Adaptation: Process a new, similar email (Email B) from "priority_test_sender@example.com".
Backend Verification: When Email B is processed by extract_features_from_email and then generate_tasks_from_email_features:
Check logs: Was the updated user_adaptation_profiles fetched and used to augment the LLM prompt or adjust the generated task's priority?
Check the newly created task in the tasks table: Is its priority now "High" (or closer to it) based on the learned adaptation?
Frontend Verification: Does the PersonalizationInsights UI now reflect this learned priority tendency?
Scenario 2: Learning from Email Re-categorization (if applicable)

Similar to Scenario 1, but focus on the user changing an AI-suggested category for an email/task via HITL or direct edit. Verify the learning engine picks this up and applies it to future similar emails.
Scenario 3: System Suggesting a Rule

Setup: Create a series of user interactions/feedback (e.g., consistently changing category for a specific sender over 5-10 emails).
Trigger Learning Engine.
Backend Verification: Check if AdaptationLearningService.generate_rule_suggestions would now produce a rule suggestion based on these patterns.
Frontend Verification: Does the SuggestedRules.tsx component fetch and display this new rule suggestion from the API? Can you accept it, and does it become an active rule in user_rules?
Scenario 4: Resetting Personalization Profile

User Action (via React Settings UI): Click the "Reset Personalization Profile" button.
Backend Verification: Is the user's user_adaptation_profiles cleared or reset to default in the database?
Test Adaptation: Process another email for this user. Verify that the AI processing now uses default behavior, not the previously learned adaptations.
For each scenario, please (AI Coder):

Outline any specific setup needed in the database or test email accounts.
Describe the expected data flow through the feedback logging, learning tasks, adaptation profile update, and then the re-application of adaptations in the AI pipeline.
Provide guidance on what specific logs and database entries (especially in feedback_logs, user_task_interactions, user_adaptation_profiles, and the AI-generated fields in emails and tasks) I should check to verify each step.
This testing will confirm that our adaptive learning loop is complete and functional, making the AI truly personalized. Good luck!

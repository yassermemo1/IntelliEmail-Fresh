Hello AI Coder,

Excellent work on the EmailChainService! It's great to see that the Thread ID matching is working perfectly and successfully identified all related emails in our test case.

You noted a 'small issue with storing the relationships in our database' (referring to the pre-computed semantic links for the updateEmailRelationships function and email_semantic_links table). Let's address this and then ensure all aspects of the findRelatedEmails function are robust.

Project: AI-Powered Email Task Manager (Business Critical)
Current Date for Context: Tuesday, May 20, 2025
Current Location Context: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

Focus for this Chunk:

Fix the issue with storing pre-computed semantic relationships in the email_semantic_links table (via the updateEmailRelationships background task/function).
Thoroughly test all correlation methods within the findRelatedEmails function: Thread ID (already good), Subject Line Similarity, and Live Semantic Similarity (vector search).
Ensure findRelatedEmails correctly combines and ranks results from these methods.
Confirm integration of findRelatedEmails into the RAG pipeline (i.e., called by extract_features_from_email task).
Detailed Requirements & Verification Steps:

Fix Storage of Pre-Computed Semantic Relationships:

Action: Investigate and fix the "small issue" preventing the updateEmailRelationships background task/function from correctly populating the email_semantic_links table with pairs of semantically similar emails and their scores.
Verification:
Run the updateEmailRelationships task/function for a test ConnectedAccount with several embedded emails.
Provide a psql query to check the contents of the email_semantic_links table. We should see new link records being created with appropriate email_id_a, email_id_b, and similarity_score.
Test Subject Line Similarity in findRelatedEmails:

Setup: Ensure you have a few test emails in a ConnectedAccount that have very similar (but not identical) cleaned subjects but different thread_ids.
Action: Call findRelatedEmails for one of these emails.
Verification: Does the function return the other emails with similar subjects? How is "similarity" determined (e.g., exact match after cleaning, fuzzy match score)? Log the cleaned subjects being compared.
Test Live Semantic Similarity (Vector Search) in findRelatedEmails:

Setup: Ensure you have test emails in a ConnectedAccount that are thematically similar but have different subjects and thread_ids. Ensure their embedding_vectors are populated.
Action: Call findRelatedEmails for one of these emails, perhaps configuring it (or testing a scenario) where Thread ID and Subject Similarity might not return enough results, forcing it to use semantic similarity.
Verification: Does the function return semantically similar emails based on vector search? Log the similarity scores of the returned items.
Test Combined Results & Ranking in findRelatedEmails:

Setup: Create a scenario where an email might have matches via Thread ID, other emails with similar subjects, and other distinct emails that are only semantically similar.
Action: Call findRelatedEmails.
Verification: How are the results ordered? Are Thread ID matches prioritized? Are duplicates handled? Does it correctly limit to max_results?
Confirm Integration into RAG Pipeline (extract_features_from_email task):

Code Review: Show the section in extract_features_from_email where EmailChainService.findRelatedEmails() is called.
Log Verification: When extract_features_from_email processes an email, add temporary logging (or show existing logs) to confirm:
findRelatedEmails was called for the current email.
What related emails (if any) were returned by the service.
How this context is being formatted and included in the prompt sent to the LLM (Ollama).
Testing & Verification for You (the User) After AI Coder Implements/Fixes:

I will provide you with psql queries and log inspection points to verify the above, similar to previous verification chunks.
This will ensure our EmailChainService is fully operational and effectively enhancing our RAG pipeline with comprehensive contextual information. Please focus on fixing the pre-computed link storage first, then on testing the different facets of findRelatedEmails."

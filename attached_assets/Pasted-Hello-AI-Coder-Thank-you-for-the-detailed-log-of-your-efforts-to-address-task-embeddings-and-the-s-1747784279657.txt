Hello AI Coder,

Thank you for the detailed log of your efforts to address task embeddings and the surrounding service import/export issues.

It appears the primary blockers are now:

Application stability due to service import/export errors (e.g., with gmailService and potentially others, preventing reliable application startup or operation).
Ensuring the automated pipeline for generating task embeddings (i.e., an RQ job triggered after a new task is created) is functional, rather than relying solely on a standalone backfill script.
While the standalone fix-task-embeddings-cjs.js script might be useful for backfilling, we need the main application's asynchronous pipeline to handle embedding generation for new tasks automatically. This pipeline seems to be affected by the service import/export issues.

Project: AI-Powered Email Task Manager (Business Critical)
Focus for this Immediate Action:

Resolve all service import/export errors to ensure the main backend application (Node.js/Express or whatever your current TS backend framework is) starts reliably and all services are correctly accessible.
Verify and fix the automated RQ job chain for task embedding generation: New Task Created -> RQ Job Queued (generate_embedding_for_task_record) -> NLP Worker processes job -> Task.embedding_vector populated with 768-dim Ollama embedding.
Detailed Steps & Verification:

Fix Service Import/Export Issues:

Action: Systematically review server/services/index.ts and all individual service files (like gmailService.ts, aiService.ts, taskService.ts, etc.).
Ensure: Correct export syntax (e.g., export class GmailService or export default GmailService or named exports in index.ts) and correct import syntax wherever these services are used (e.g., in API route handlers, other services, or RQ job files).
Test: Attempt to start the main backend application. It must start cleanly without any "module not found," "is not a constructor," or similar import/export related errors. Provide logs if issues persist.
Verify Automated Task Embedding Pipeline:

Review Task Creation Logic: Check where new tasks are created (e.g., in an RQ job like generate_tasks_from_email_features or in an API endpoint for manual task creation).
Ensure RQ Job Trigger: Confirm that after a new Task record is successfully saved to PostgreSQL, an RQ job (e.g., generate_embedding_for_task_record(taskId)) is correctly enqueued to the nlp queue. Show the code that enqueues this job.
Verify RQ Worker for nlp queue: Ensure an RQ worker process is running and listening to the nlp queue.
Test End-to-End for a NEW Task:
Action: Trigger the creation of 1-2 new tasks (either by processing a new test email through the full pipeline or by manually creating a task via an API if that endpoint is stable).
Monitor: Watch the nlp RQ worker logs for the execution of generate_embedding_for_task_record.
Database Verification (psql): Provide the output of the following query for the newly created tasks:
SQL
-- Replace 'NEW_TASK_ID_1', 'NEW_TASK_ID_2' with actual new task IDs
SELECT id, title, 
       embedding_vector IS NOT NULL AS has_embedding, 
       array_length(embedding_vector::real[], 1) AS embedding_dimension 
FROM tasks 
WHERE id IN ('NEW_TASK_ID_1', 'NEW_TASK_ID_2');
Expected: has_embedding should be true, and embedding_dimension should be 768.
Regarding the fix-task-embeddings-cjs.js script:

If this script successfully ran and backfilled embeddings for existing tasks, that's good for data cleanup. Please confirm if it completed successfully and if existing tasks now show 768-dim embeddings in the database.
However, our primary focus now is to ensure the automated pipeline for new tasks is working correctly within the main application structure.
Please prioritize stabilizing the application startup by fixing service import/export errors first, and then confirm the automated task embedding pipeline for newly created tasks. Let me know the outcome of these steps.

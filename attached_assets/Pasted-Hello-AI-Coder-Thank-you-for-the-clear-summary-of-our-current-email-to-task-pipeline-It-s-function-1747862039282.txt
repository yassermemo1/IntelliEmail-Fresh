Hello AI Coder,
Thank you for the clear summary of our current email-to-task pipeline. It's functioning well, ingesting emails, using OpenAI (or configured LLM) for analysis and initial task identification, generating embeddings, and supporting HITL.
Now, we need to significantly enhance the detail, value, and categorization of the tasks generated by the AI, and lay the groundwork for a reminder system, to make the application a truly powerful planning tool. This will build upon the existing pipeline.
Project: AI-Powered Email Task Manager (Business Critical)
Current Date for Context: Thursday, May 22, 2025, 12:10 AM (Riyadh Time, +03)
Current Location Context: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
Focus for this Chunk:
 * Upgrade the LLM interaction to extract much richer, structured details for each potential task identified within an email.
 * Implement an expanded and more useful set of task categories.
 * Update the task generation logic to use this enhanced AI output to create more detailed and contextually relevant tasks.
 * Add fields to the Task model to support future reminder functionality based on AI suggestions.
I. Enhance LLM Prompt & Output for Rich Task Details (Modify NlpService and the prompt construction in extract_features_from_email RQ/Celery task):
 * New Structured Output for Each Suggested Task within ai_suggested_tasks_json:
   * Modify the system prompt for your LLM (OpenAI/Ollama llama3). When it identifies potential tasks in an email, instruct it to return an array of structured task objects. Each object in the ai_suggested_tasks_json (currently being populated in the emails table) should now aim for this richer structure:
     {
  "suggested_title": "Concise, action-oriented title (e.g., 'Finalize Q3 budget report')",
  "detailed_description": "More detailed description including key context or sub-points from the email relevant to this specific task.",
  "source_snippet": "The exact sentence(s) from the email that triggered this task suggestion.",
  "actors_involved": ["Person A", "Department B"], // People/entities directly related to this task
  "suggested_priority_level": "P3_Medium", // From P1_Critical, P2_High, P3_Medium, P4_Low
  "extracted_deadline_text": "by next Friday EOD", // Textual deadline for this specific task
  "suggested_category": "ReportGeneration_Submission", // From the new expanded list
  "estimated_effort_minutes": 60, // Optional: LLM's best guess
  "is_recurring_hint": false, // boolean: e.g., from "weekly status update"
  "reminder_suggestion_text": "remind me 1 day before deadline", // Optional: LLM's suggestion for a reminder
  "confidence_in_task_extraction": 0.85 // LLM's confidence for *this specific task*
}

   * Update the main LLM system prompt to request this detailed structure for each item in the suggested_tasks array within its primary JSON output.
 * Expanded Task Categories (Implement & Use):
   * AI Coder, please define and use a list of at least 10-12 relevant business task categories. We previously discussed examples like:
     * FollowUp_ResponseNeeded
     * Report_Generation_Submission
     * Meeting_Coordination_Prep
     * Review_Approval_Feedback
     * Research_Investigation_Analysis
     * Planning_Strategy_Development
     * Client_Vendor_Communication
     * Internal_Project_Task
     * Administrative_Logistics
     * Urgent_Action_Required (could also be indicated by priority)
     * Information_To_Digest_Review (for items needing attention but not a discrete task)
     * Personal_Reminder_Appt
   * Ensure the LLM prompt guides the AI to choose from this new, specific list for suggested_category within each task object.
II. Backend - Update Email Model's AI Feature Storage:
 * emails.ai_suggested_tasks_json (JSONB):
   * Confirm this column will now store the array of these new, richer task objects.
 * emails.ai_classification_details_json (JSONB):
   * This can continue to store the overall email analysis (sentiment, overall category if different, summary, justifications, etc.), while ai_suggested_tasks_json holds the detailed task breakdowns.
III. Backend - Refactor generate_tasks_from_email_features RQ/Celery Task (app/tasks/task_creation_tasks.py):
 * Consume Richer Task Data:
   * This task will iterate through the array of rich task objects now found in Email.ai_suggested_tasks_json.
 * Populate Task Model with Enhanced Details:
   * For each suggested task object from the JSON:
     * title: Use suggested_title.
     * description: Use detailed_description. Consider appending source_snippet if helpful.
     * priority: Map suggested_priority_level to your existing Task.priority values.
     * due_date: Use your DeadlineParserService on extracted_deadline_text.
     * category: Use suggested_category (ensure your Task.category field can store these new, more specific category strings or map them appropriately).
     * ai_confidence_score: Use confidence_in_task_extraction.
     * requires_hitl_review: Set based on this task-specific confidence score.
     * original_ai_suggestion_json: Store the entire rich task object from the LLM here for better HITL context and future learning.
     * estimated_completion_time_minutes (if you have this field on Task model): Use estimated_effort_minutes.
     * New Task Model Fields (see IV): Populate is_recurring_suggestion and ai_suggested_reminder_text.
 * Apply User Adaptations: Your AdaptationLearningService.apply_preferences_to_task() should still be called to allow user-learned preferences to refine these AI-generated details.
IV. Backend - Task Model Enhancements (app/models/task_model.py):
 * Add New Fields for Reminders & Recurrence Hints:
   * is_recurring_suggestion: Column(Boolean, nullable=True)
   * ai_suggested_reminder_text: Column(String, nullable=True)
   * reminder_settings_json: Column(JSONB, nullable=True) // For user-defined reminders - to be used in next chunk
   * next_reminder_at: Column(DateTime, nullable=True, index=True) // For user-defined reminders - to be used in next chunk
 * Create and apply Alembic migrations for these new Task model fields.
V. Testing and Verification:
 * LLM Output Structure:
   * Process several diverse test emails known to contain multiple potential tasks, deadlines, and different implied categories.
   * Log and inspect the raw JSON output from the LLM. Does it consistently produce an array of task objects in ai_suggested_tasks_json with all the new detailed fields (suggested_title, detailed_description, source_snippet, suggested_priority_level, extracted_deadline_text, suggested_category, is_recurring_hint, reminder_suggestion_text, confidence_in_task_extraction)?
 * Task Creation Details:
   * For each test email, inspect the Task records created in the PostgreSQL database.
   * Are the title, description, priority, category, and due_date fields now populated with much more specific and useful information derived directly from the LLM's rich output?
   * Are the new fields is_recurring_suggestion and ai_suggested_reminder_text being populated on the Task records?
   * Is original_ai_suggestion_json on the Task record storing the detailed task object from the LLM?
 * Error Handling: Test with emails that might not have clear tasks. Does the system handle empty ai_suggested_tasks_json gracefully?
This major enhancement will significantly improve the quality and 'value' of the AI-generated tasks. Once this is complete and verified, the next step will be to build the actual reminder system and then enhance the frontend UI to display these richer tasks and allow users to set their own reminders.

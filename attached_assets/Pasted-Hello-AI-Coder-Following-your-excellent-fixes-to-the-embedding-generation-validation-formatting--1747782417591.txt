Hello AI Coder,

Following your excellent fixes to the embedding generation, validation, formatting, and SQL storage methods (standardizing on 768-dimensional vectors for Ollama nomic-embed-text and ensuring pgvector compatibility), we now need to perform a detailed step-by-step verification of the entire pipeline to confirm these fixes are working perfectly and that downstream processes are also successful.

Project: AI-Powered Email Task Manager (Business Critical)
Current Date & Time for Context: Wednesday, May 21, 2025, 2:00 AM (Riyadh Time, +03)
Current Location Context: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

Focus for this Verification:
Execute and meticulously verify the end-to-end processing for a small batch of real emails from a connected test Gmail account (using IMAP/App Password). Confirm each stage, from fetching through embedding, AI feature extraction, task generation, task embedding, and finally basic semantic search, is error-free and data is persisted correctly.

Prerequisites:

All your recent embedding system fixes are implemented.
Your local host environment is fully set up: PostgreSQL (with pgvector ready for 768-dim vectors), Redis, FastAPI backend, all RQ worker types (email_sync, nlp, task_creation), and host-based Ollama (with nomic-embed-text for 768-dim embeddings and llama3 for analysis) are running and correctly configured via the .env file.
A test Gmail account is configured as a ConnectedAccount with a valid (no-spaces) App Password and has 3-5 new/unprocessed, varied test emails. Note the connected_account_id for this account.
Please perform the following steps and report your findings, including log snippets and psql outputs for each relevant stage:

Step 1: Trigger Email Ingestion for Test Gmail Account
* Action: Trigger the initial sync (or ensure real-time sync picks up new emails) for the designated test Gmail ConnectedAccount. Focus on getting 3-5 specific real emails from this account into the pipeline.
* Report:
* Confirm the API call to trigger sync was successful (e.g., 202 Accepted).
* Initial log snippets from the email_sync RQ worker showing it has picked up jobs for this account and is fetching these specific emails.

Step 2: Verify Email Fetching & Basic Storage (RQ email_sync worker)
* Action: Allow time for the Workspace_and_store_single_email_details RQ jobs to complete for the target emails.
* Verification & Report:
* Logs: Show log snippets from the email_sync worker confirming successful fetching and basic storage of these 3-5 emails.
* Database (psql): Provide the output of:
sql -- Replace 'YOUR_TEST_CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID' and list actual subjects or provider_email_ids SELECT id, subject, sender_email, received_at, body_text IS NOT NULL AS has_text_body FROM emails WHERE connected_account_id = 'YOUR_TEST_CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID' AND subject IN ('Subject of Test Email 1', 'Subject of Test Email 2', 'Subject of Test Email 3') ORDER BY received_at DESC;
Confirm these emails are present.

Step 3: Verify Email Embedding Generation & Storage (RQ nlp worker)
* Action: Allow time for the generate_embedding_for_email RQ jobs to complete for the emails from Step 2.
* Verification & Report:
* Logs: Show log snippets from the nlp worker for these emails, specifically messages related to:
* The new embedding validation logic (e.g., checking for non-numeric values).
* The improved vector formatting logic.
* Successful calls to Ollama (nomic-embed-text).
* Successful saving of the embedding to the database.
* Database (psql): Provide the output of:
sql -- Use IDs or subjects from Step 2 SELECT id, subject, embedding_vector IS NOT NULL AS has_embedding, array_length(embedding_vector::real[], 1) AS embedding_dim, metadata->>'embeddingGenerated' AS emb_generated_meta, metadata->>'embeddingDimensions' AS emb_dim_meta FROM emails WHERE id IN ('email_id_1', 'email_id_2', 'email_id_3'); -- Use actual IDs
Confirm has_embedding is true, embedding_dim is 768, and the metadata fields are correctly populated.

Step 4: Verify AI Feature Extraction (RQ nlp worker)
* Action: Allow time for the extract_features_from_email RQ jobs to complete for the emails from Step 2.
* Verification & Report:
* Logs: Show log snippets from the nlp worker for these emails, indicating successful calls to Ollama (llama3) for feature extraction (using RAG context) and successful saving of features.
* Database (psql): Provide the output of:
sql -- Use IDs from Step 2 SELECT id, subject, ai_extracted_summary, ai_suggested_tasks_json, ai_classification_details_json, ai_processing_confidence FROM emails WHERE id IN ('email_id_1', 'email_id_2', 'email_id_3');
Confirm these fields are populated with plausible, non-generic, structured data from Ollama.

Step 5: Verify Task Generation from AI Features (RQ task_creation worker)
* Action: Allow time for the generate_tasks_from_email_features RQ jobs to complete.
* Verification & Report:
* Logs: Show log snippets from the task_creation worker for these emails, indicating tasks are being generated based on ai_suggested_tasks_json.
* Database (psql): Provide the output of:
sql -- Use Email IDs from Step 2 SELECT t.id AS task_id, t.title, t.priority, t.status, t.due_date, t.source_email_id, e.subject AS source_email_subject FROM tasks t JOIN emails e ON t.source_email_id = e.id WHERE e.id IN ('email_id_1', 'email_id_2', 'email_id_3') ORDER BY t.created_at DESC;
Confirm tasks are created, linked correctly, and have attributes derived from the AI features.

Step 6: Verify Task Embedding Generation (RQ nlp worker)
* Action: Allow time for generate_embedding_for_task_record RQ jobs for newly created tasks.
* Verification & Report:
* Logs: Show log snippets from the nlp worker for these new tasks.
* Database (psql): Provide the output of:
sql -- Use Task IDs from Step 5 SELECT id, title, embedding_vector IS NOT NULL AS has_embedding, array_length(embedding_vector::real[], 1) AS embedding_dimension FROM tasks WHERE id IN ('task_id_A', 'task_id_B'); -- Use actual Task IDs
Confirm has_embedding is true and embedding_dimension is 768 for these tasks.

Step 7: Verify Semantic Search API Call (Basic Test)
* Action: Make a curl request to your test API endpoint for vector similarity search (e.g., /api/test/vector-similarity/{one_of_the_processed_email_ids}).
* Verification & Report:
* Provide the curl command used.
* Paste the JSON response.
* Confirm the API call is successful (no vector format errors, no dimension errors) and returns plausible semantic matches.
* Check FastAPI logs for any errors during this search.

Please meticulously go through these steps and provide a detailed report with the requested log snippets and psql outputs. This will give us strong confidence that the entire corrected pipeline is working as expected.

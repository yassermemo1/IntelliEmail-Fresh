"Hello AI Coder,

Your analysis is correct. We have a critical inconsistency in how embedding_vector is defined and used. The shared/schema.ts defining it as text("embedding_vector").array() is causing conflicts with pgvector's native vector type, leading to errors like 'Vector contents must start with "[".'

Our immediate and highest priority is to fix the definition and implementation of embedding_vector columns across the entire stack. We need to ensure we are using the native pgvector type.

Current Location Context: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

Focus for This Critical Fix:
Correctly define and implement embedding_vector columns in emails and tasks tables using the native pgvector type, ensuring consistency between schema definitions (like shared/schema.ts if it influences backend models), SQLAlchemy models, Alembic migrations, and database operations. We are targeting 768 dimensions for Ollama's nomic-embed-text.

Detailed Steps:

Correct Schema Definition (e.g., shared/schema.ts or equivalent primary schema source):

Action: If shared/schema.ts (or any other primary schema definition tool you are using, like a TypeScript ORM's schema definition) is the source of truth or influences your SQLAlchemy models:
Modify it to define embedding_vector using a construct that represents the native PostgreSQL vector type provided by pgvector, with a dimension of 768.
This is NOT text[]. How you represent this depends on the specific TypeScript ORM or schema tool. If it doesn't have direct pgvector support, you might need to define it as a custom type that maps to vector(768) in raw SQL for migrations.
If shared/schema.ts is purely for frontend types and doesn't drive DB schema: Then the focus is solely on SQLAlchemy models and Alembic.
Correct SQLAlchemy Models (app/models/email_model.py, app/models/task_model.py):

Action: Ensure the definition is:
Python
from pgvector.sqlalchemy import VECTOR
# ...
embedding_vector = Column(VECTOR(768), nullable=True)
Remove any imports or definitions that might incorrectly type it as an array of text.
Correct Alembic Migrations (alembic/versions/):

Action:
Review all existing migration scripts. Remove any incorrect attempts to define embedding_vector as TEXT[] or JSONB.
Ensure there's a clear migration that creates the embedding_vector columns in both emails and tasks tables as VECTOR(768).
Crucially, this migration MUST run op.execute("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;") BEFORE any VECTOR type columns are created.
Ensure this migration also creates the HNSW indexes (e.g., op.create_index('ix_emails_embedding_vector_hnsw_cosine', 'emails', ['embedding_vector'], postgresql_using='hnsw', postgresql_ops={'embedding_vector': 'vector_cosine_ops'})) on these VECTOR(768) columns.
Suggestion: It might be cleanest to:
Create a new Alembic migration that explicitly op.drop_column() for any incorrectly defined embedding_vector columns (if they exist from previous failed attempts).
Then, in the same or a subsequent migration, op.execute("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;") (if not already reliably done in the very first migration).
Then, op.add_column() with the correct VECTOR(768) type for emails.embedding_vector and tasks.embedding_vector.
Then, op.create_index() for the HNSW indexes on these correct columns.
Verify Data Handling in Code:

NlpService / Embedding Generation Tasks: Ensure that when an embedding (which is a Python List[float]) is returned from Ollama, it is passed directly to the SQLAlchemy model's embedding_vector attribute. The pgvector Python library and its SQLAlchemy integration will handle the conversion to the database's required format. Do not manually convert it to a JSON string or a text array string in your Python code before saving.
Semantic Search Service: Ensure queries using operators like <=> (cosine distance) are being made against columns that are truly of the vector type.
Testing (After Fixes and Migrations):

Clean Database State: Start with a fresh database if possible (docker compose down -v then docker compose up -d postgres_db, then docker compose run --rm backend alembic upgrade head).
Process a Test Email: Run the full pipeline for one or two test emails.
Verify psql:
Check column type: \d emails and \d tasks must show embedding_vector as type vector.
Check data: SELECT embedding_vector FROM emails WHERE id = 'your_test_email_id'; Should show a vector like [0.1,0.2,...].
Check dimension: SELECT array_length(embedding_vector::real[], 1) AS embedding_dimension FROM emails WHERE id = 'your_test_email_id'; Should show 768.
Test Semantic Search API: Verify it returns results without vector format errors.
This is a foundational fix. Please prioritize making the embedding_vector column definitions and types natively pgvector compatible (as VECTOR(768)) across your schema definitions, SQLAlchemy models, and Alembic migrations. Let me know when you're ready to test this again."

"Hello AI Coder,

We've been through several cycles of implementation, testing, and fixing across various complex features like the RAG pipeline, multi-provider email sync (including the Gmail IMAP/App Password fix), advanced AI processing with Ollama, task generation, comprehensive frontend UIs, and foundational work for security and observability.

To ensure we have a clear, shared understanding of where the project stands right now, please provide a detailed Current State of the Application Report.

Project: AI-Powered Email Task Manager (Business Critical)
Current Date for Context: Tuesday, May 20, 2025, 11:56 PM (Riyadh Time, +03)
Current Location Context: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

Please structure your report to cover the following areas:

Overall Stability & Core Pipeline Functionality:

Based on your most recent work and verifications (including any results from attempts to run scripts like verify_full.sh or similar end-to-end tests):
Is the core backend pipeline (Email Connection -> Email Sync (for Gmail IMAP/App Password & EWS) -> RQ Job Processing -> Ollama for Embeddings (768-dim) -> Ollama for AI Feature Extraction -> PostgreSQL/pgvector Persistence -> Task Generation -> Task Embedding Persistence) currently stable and demonstrably working end-to-end for at least one email provider (e.g., Gmail with App Password)?
What is your confidence level in this core pipeline?
Key Implemented Features - Current Working Status (What's Great - ✅):

For each major feature group below, briefly state its current working status from your perspective and highlight key achievements or components that are solid:
Email Account Connection & Management: (Gmail IMAP/App Password, EWS credential handling, ConnectedAccount model & APIs, Frontend UI in Settings for connecting/managing).
Email Synchronization: (Initial sync, real-time sync foundations for Gmail/EWS via RQ).
AI Processing with Ollama: (Embedding generation with nomic-embed-text 768-dim, feature extraction with llama3 using the "10x better" structured JSON prompt, RAG context retrieval via EmailChainService and SemanticSearchService).
Task Generation & Management: (Creating Task records from AI features, task embeddings, backend Task CRUD APIs, frontend Task UI with filtering/sorting, TaskFormModal).
Database & pgvector: (Schema correctness for all core tables including emails and tasks with VECTOR(768) and HNSW indexes, other tables like user_rules, feedback_logs, etc.).
2-Way Email Sync Actions: (Backend logic and frontend UI elements).
HITL Workflow: (Backend APIs and React frontend UI).
User-Configurable LLMs: (Backend factory/services and frontend settings UI).
Adaptive Learning Engine: (Backend services for processing feedback/interactions and applying adaptations, frontend UI for insights/suggestions).
Frontend API Client & Error Handling: (apiClient.ts, apiWrapper, standardized responses, toast/error components).
Automated Testing: (Progress on unit, integration, and E2E tests; verify_full.sh script status).
Current Critical Issues & Blockers (What's Bad - ❌ or ⚠️):

What are the most significant bugs, instabilities, or incomplete integrations that are currently preventing smooth end-to-end operation or testing?
Are there still any fundamental issues with:
Frontend-to-Backend API communication (404s, 500s for specific features)?
SQLAlchemy or other backend library compatibility (e.g., with the current Python version on the host)?
RQ worker stability or task processing failures?
Ollama integration (e.g., consistent responses, performance)?
Data integrity (e.g., data not being saved correctly, mismatches between UI and DB)?
Be specific (e.g., "The EWS real-time sync polling is not yet reliably triggering the processing pipeline," or "The React Semantic Search UI still shows mock data and isn't fully connected to the backend API.").
Key Missing Pieces for a "User Testable V1":

Beyond critical bugs, what key functionalities or UI components are still significantly incomplete or not yet implemented, which would be essential for me to conduct thorough UAT as a single user connecting my own accounts? (For example, is the full React HITL review flow testable end-to-end? Is the user-defined rules engine UI fully connected and functional?)
Your Assessment of verify_full.sh (or equivalent E2E testing):

Based on your most recent work on this script and the system state, what's its current effectiveness? What parts of the pipeline does it successfully test, and what parts are still problematic to verify with it?
Your Recommended Next Immediate Focus:

Given your analysis, what is the single most important area or issue you believe you need to work on next to move the project towards a stable, testable state for the core email-to-task workflow with real data?
Your honest and detailed assessment of the current overall state, highlighting both what's working well and what's critically broken or missing, will be extremely helpful for us to plan the immediate next steps effectively. Focus on the practical reality of the application's current condition.

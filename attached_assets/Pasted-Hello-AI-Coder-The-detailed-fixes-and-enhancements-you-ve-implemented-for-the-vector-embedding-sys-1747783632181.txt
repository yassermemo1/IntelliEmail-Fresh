Hello AI Coder,

The detailed fixes and enhancements you've implemented for the vector embedding system (standardizing on 768 dimensions, robust validation, proper SQL formatting for pgvector, and enhanced aiService.ts logic for OpenAI/Ollama) are excellent and address critical previous issues! This is a significant improvement.

Now that the embedding pipeline is much more robust and standardized on 768-dimensional vectors, we need to perform a full end-to-end re-verification of the entire backend pipeline. This is to ensure that emails are synced, processed with these correct embeddings by Ollama, all AI features are extracted, tasks are generated, and task embeddings are also correctly created and stored with 768 dimensions.

Project: AI-Powered Email Task Manager (Business Critical)
Current Date for Context: Wednesday, May 21, 2025
Current Location Context: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

Focus for this Verification:
Execute and meticulously verify the end-to-end processing for a batch of real emails from a connected test Gmail account (using IMAP/App Password). Confirm each stage, from fetching through 768-dim embedding, Ollama AI feature extraction, task generation, task embedding (768-dim), and finally basic semantic search, is error-free and data is persisted correctly.

Prerequisites:

All your recent embedding system fixes are implemented and active.
Your local host environment is fully set up: PostgreSQL (with pgvector configured for vector(768) columns and HNSW indexes), Redis, FastAPI backend, all RQ worker types (email_sync, nlp, task_creation), and host-based Ollama (with nomic-embed-text for 768-dim embeddings and llama3 for analysis) are running.
A test Gmail account is configured as a ConnectedAccount with a valid (no-spaces) App Password and has 5-10 varied, recent emails. Note the connected_account_id.
Please Perform and Report on the Following Verification Steps (Similar to our previous full E2E test plan, but now with the fixed embedding system):

Trigger Email Processing for Test Gmail Account:

Initiate the sync for the test Gmail ConnectedAccount to process 5-10 real emails.
Monitor RQ worker logs and Ollama logs.
Database Verification - emails Table (Post-Processing):

For the processed test emails, provide psql query output to verify:
embedding_vector is populated, is a 768-element vector (array_length(embedding_vector::real[], 1) = 768), and contains valid numbers.
The emails.metadata JSONB column reflects embeddingDimensions: 768 and no unexpected embeddingPadded or embeddingTruncated flags (unless an email was truly >20k chars).
All ai_... feature columns (summary, suggested tasks JSON, classification details JSON, etc.) are populated with plausible data from Ollama. (Show sample data for one or two fully processed emails).
Database Verification - tasks Table (Post-Processing):

For tasks generated from these emails, provide psql query output to verify:
Task records are created and linked to source_email_id.
Task attributes reflect Ollama's analysis from the email.
tasks.embedding_vector is populated with a 768-dimensional vector. (Show sample data for one or two generated tasks).
Semantic Search API Test (Using 768-dim Vectors):

Use your test API endpoint (e.g., curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/test/vector-similarity/{one_of_the_processed_email_ids_with_768dim_embedding}" | jq) or perform a search via any UI that hits the semantic search backend.
Verify: The search completes without vector dimension errors and returns plausible semantic matches based on the 768-dim embeddings. Check FastAPI logs for any errors.
Log Review:

Confirm RQ worker logs show successful processing through all stages for these emails and tasks, especially the new validation and formatting logic in aiService.ts.
Confirm no "vector dimension mismatch" or "vector format" errors.
Expected Outcome:

Definitive confirmation that the entire backend pipeline now works flawlessly with a consistent 768-dimensional vector strategy using Ollama and pgvector.
All data, including correctly dimensioned embeddings and rich AI features, is persisted in PostgreSQL.
This re-verification is crucial after the significant embedding system fixes. Once confirmed, we can very confidently move to the full React frontend integration and testing.

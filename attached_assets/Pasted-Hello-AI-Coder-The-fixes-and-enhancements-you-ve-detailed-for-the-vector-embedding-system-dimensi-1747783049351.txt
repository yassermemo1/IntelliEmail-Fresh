Hello AI Coder,

The fixes and enhancements you've detailed for the vector embedding system (dimension standardization to 768, robust validation, HNSW indexing, SQL formatting, and metadata logging) are excellent and precisely what was needed!

Project: AI-Powered Email Task Manager (Business Critical)
Focus for this Chunk: Apply these changes, re-generate embeddings for all data to ensure 768-dimensional consistency, and then thoroughly test the semantic search and RAG functionalities that depend on these correct embeddings.

Detailed Steps & Verification:

Apply Database Migrations:

Action: Execute the fix_vector_dimensions.ts (or equivalent Alembic) migration script.
Verification:
Confirm the migration completes successfully.
Use psql to verify that emails.embedding_vector and tasks.embedding_vector columns are now vector(768).
Verify (e.g., with \di) that HNSW indexes with vector_cosine_ops are created on these columns.
Verify that any previously stored embeddings with incorrect dimensions have been set to NULL in the database (and their metadata updated).
Run Batch Embedding Generation for All Emails and Tasks:

Action: Trigger your batch embedding RQ/Celery tasks (batch_generate_email_embeddings and batch_generate_task_embeddings) to process ALL emails and tasks that currently have embedding_vector IS NULL. This will use your Ollama nomic-embed-text model and the new robust embedding generation logic.
Monitoring: Closely monitor RQ worker logs (nlp queue) and Ollama logs for successful processing and any errors (especially related to dimension handling or API calls).
Verification (after batch processing):
Use your /api/test/vector-stats endpoint. It should now show a very high percentage (ideally 100% or close) of emails and tasks having 768-dimensional embeddings.
Spot-check several email and task records in the database to confirm their embedding_vector is populated and the embedding metadata (dimensions, source) is correct.
Test Semantic Search Functionality:

Action: Using your test API endpoint (/api/test/vector-similarity/{email_id}) and also through the React frontend's semantic search UI (if connected):
Perform at least 5-10 different natural language queries based on the content of your test emails.
Test with queries that should find specific emails, and queries that should find thematically similar but differently worded emails.
Verification:
Are relevant results returned?
Is the performance acceptable (leveraging HNSW indexes)?
Are there any vector-related errors in the FastAPI or PostgreSQL logs?
Test RAG Context Retrieval and Impact on AI Feature Extraction:

Action: Process 2-3 new test emails through the entire pipeline (sync -> store -> embed -> RAG context -> extract features -> task gen -> task embed).
Setup for RAG Test: Ensure these new emails are thematically related to some of the emails/tasks already processed and embedded in step 2, so RAG can find context.
Verification (CRITICAL):
In the RQ worker logs for extract_features_from_email for these new test emails:
Confirm that relevant historical context (from previously embedded emails/tasks) was retrieved by SemanticSearchService.
Confirm (e.g., via detailed logging of the prompt) that this RAG context was included in the prompt sent to Ollama llama3.
In the emails table: For these new test emails, qualitatively examine the ai_classification_details_json and other ai_... fields. Does the output from llama3 (summary, suggested tasks, category, priority) appear more accurate or contextually informed than it might have been without RAG?
This comprehensive testing will validate that our entire embedding and AI analysis pipeline is now robust, consistent, and leveraging semantic context effectively. Please report your findings for each step.
